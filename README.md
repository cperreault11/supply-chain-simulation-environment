# miniSCOT

miniSCOT is a simulation tool that lets users play with the supply chain
architecture and algorithms at any level of fidelity. The system allows users to
‘snap together’ their own customer supply chain out of pre-built modules, and
the open-source Python codebase allows easy development of new components and
baselines.
